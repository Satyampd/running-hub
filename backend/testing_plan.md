**Testing Plan: Running Hub Backend**

**1. Unit Tests:**

*   **Models (`backend/app/models/`):**
    *   Verify database model definitions.
    *   Test relationships between models.
    *   Validate data type constraints.
*   **Schemas (`backend/app/schemas/`):**
    *   Test Pydantic schema validation for request and response data.
    *   Verify data transformation and serialization.
*   **API Endpoints (`backend/app/api/`):**
    *   Mock external dependencies (database, services).
    *   Test individual API endpoint logic.
    *   Validate request handling and response generation.
    *   Check error handling and status codes.
*   **Core Logic (`backend/app/core/`):**
    *   Test business logic functions.
    *   Verify algorithms and data processing.
*   **Scrapers (`backend/app/scrapers/`):**
    *   Test individual scraper functionality.
    *   Mock external website responses.
    *   Validate data extraction and parsing.
*   **Database Interactions (`backend/app/db/`):**
    *   Test database connection and session management.
    *   Verify CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

**2. Integration Tests:**

*   Test interactions between API endpoints and the database.
*   Verify data flow through different components.
*   Test integration with external services (if any).

**3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**

*   Simulate user scenarios from API request to database persistence.
    *   Test complete workflows and use cases.
    *   Validate overall application behavior.

**4. Performance Tests:**

*   Measure API response times under load.
*   Identify performance bottlenecks.
*   Test database query performance.

**5. Security Tests:**

*   Test authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   Check for common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
*   Validate input sanitization.

**Tools and Frameworks:**

*   **Pytest:** For writing and running unit and integration tests.
*   **Requests:** For making HTTP requests to API endpoints in E2E tests.
*   **Coverage.py:** For measuring test coverage.

**Test Execution:**

*   Run unit tests frequently during development.
*   Run integration and E2E tests before deployments.
*   Automate test execution using a CI/CD pipeline.
